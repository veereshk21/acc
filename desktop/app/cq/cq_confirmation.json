For details on the availability of this service and wireless emergency alert capable devices, please ask a sales representative, or go to <a href='https://www.verizonwireless.com/govalerts' title='Government Alerts'>www.verizonwireless.com/govalerts</a> .</p> <h3 class='bold  fontSize_4 margin12 noSideMargin'>DATA SERVICES</h3> <p class='margin12 noSideMargin'>Verizon Wireless charges you for all data and content sent or received using our network (including any network overhead and/or Internet Protocol overhead associated with content sent or received)as well as resolution of Internet Protocol addresses from domain names. Sending or receiving data using a virtual private network (VPN) involves additional VPN overhead for which you will be charged. Please note that certain applications or widgets periodically send and receive data in the background, without any action by the user, and you will be billed for such data use. Applications may automatically re-initiate data sessions without your pressing or clicking the SEND or connect button. Data sessions automatically terminate after 24 hours. A data session is inactive when no data is being transferred. Data sessions may seem inactive while data is actively being transferred, or may seem active when the data is actually cached and data is not being transferred. If you have a Data Only plan and use voice service, domestic voice calls will be billed at $0.25/minute.</p> <p class='margin12 noSideMargin'>We are implementing optimization and transcoding technologies in our network to transmit data files in a more efficient manner to allow available network capacity to benefit the greatest number of users. These techniques include caching less data, using less capacity, and sizing the video more appropriately for the device. The optimization process is agnostic to the content itself and to the website that provides it. While we invest much effort to avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression process and while any change to the file is likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the file as displayed on your device. For a further, more detailed explanation of these techniques, please visit <a href='https://www.verizonwireless.com/vzwoptimization' title='Verizon Optimization'>www.verizonwireless.com/vzwoptimization</a></p> <p class='margin12 noSideMargin'>You may use Mobile Hotspot or any other Wi-Fi hotspot or tethering service to use your smartphone or basic phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot or to tether it to your computer or tablet. If you subscribe to a data plan or package with an unlimited data allowance, there is an additional monthly fee to do so.</p> <p class='margin12 noSideMargin'>Data transfer amounts will vary based on application. If you download an audio or video file, the file may be downloaded in sections or in its entirety; data charged will apply to the portion downloaded, regardless of whether you listen to or watch all of it. You may access and monitor your own data usage during a particular billing period, including during the Return Period, by accessing My Verizon online or by contacting Customer Service.</p> <p class='margin12 noSideMargin'><span>Data Services: Permitted Uses.</span> You can use our Data Services for accessing the Internet and for such uses as: (i) Internet browsing; (ii) email; (iii) intranet access (including accessing corporate intranets, email and individual productivity applications made available by your company); (iv) uploading, downloading and streaming of audio, video and games; and (v) Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).</p><h4 class='bold fontSize_4 margin12 noSideMargin'>Data Services:</h4> Prohibited Uses. <p>You may not use our Data Services for illegal purposes or purposes that infringe upon others' intellectual property rights, or in a manner that interferes with other users' service; that violates trade and economic sanctions and prohibitions as promulgated by the departments of Commerce, Treasury or any other U.S. government agency; that interferes with the network's ability to fairly allocate capacity among users. Examples of prohibited usage include: (i) server devices or host computer applications that are broadcast to multiple servers or recipients such that they could enable 'bots' or similar routines (as set forth in more detail in (ii) below) or otherwise degrade network capacity or functionality; (ii) 'auto-responders,' 'cancel-bots,' or similar automated or manual routines that generate amounts of net traffic that could disrupt net user groups or e-mail use by others; (iii) generating 'spam' or unsolicited commercial or bulk e-mail (or activities that facilitate the dissemination of such e-mail); (iv) any activity that adversely affects the ability of other users or systems to use either Verizon Wireless' services or the Internet-based resources of others, including the generation or dissemination of viruses, malware, or 'denial of service' attacks; (v) accessing, or attempting to access without authority, the information, accounts or devices of others, or to penetrate, or attempt to penetrate, Verizon Wireless' or another entity's network or systems; or (vi) running software or other devices that maintain continuous active Internet connections when a computer's connection would otherwise be idle, or 'keep alive' functions, unless they adhere to Verizon Wireless' requirements for such usage, which may be changed from time to time.</p> <p class='margin12 noSideMargin'> We further reserve the right to take measures to protect our network and other users from harm, compromised capacity or degradation in performance.
